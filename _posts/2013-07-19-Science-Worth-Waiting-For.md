Nature [reports](http://www.nature.com/news/world-s-slowest-moving-drop-caught-on-camera-at-last-1.13418) 
that on July 11, 2013, a falling drop of tar pitch was recorded on video for the first time ever.

The experiment, at Trinity College, in Dublin, Ireland, was 70 years in the making. 
Why did it take so long? Because, as Nature points out, tar pitch is "the world's slowest-moving drop" - 
it's so slow that at room temperature it doesn't even look fluid and will even shatter if struck. 
However, as both this and a similar [eponymous experiment](http://smp.uq.edu.au/content/pitch-drop-experiment) 
at the University of Queensland in Australia, are attempting to demonstrate (and document), 
tar pitch is actually a highly *viscious* liquid.

Viscosity is a measure of how resistant fluids are to disturbances from stress. 
It takes less energy to (for example) stir water than to stir honey. The higher the 
viscosity, the more resistant that fluid is to external stress, and the less obvious the 
fluidity. For example, water is much less viscous than honey. 

Pitch is so vicious that only eight drops have fallen since the Australian experiment 
was set up in 1927, 76 years ago. That's one drop almost every ten years. And before the 
Trinity College drop this month, the process had never been caught on film.
