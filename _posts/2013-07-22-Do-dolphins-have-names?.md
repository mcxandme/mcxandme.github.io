The answer is "yes" according to a study titled ["Bottlenose dolphins can use learned 
vocal labels to address each other,"](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/07/17/1304459110.abstract) out in the July 22nd issue of the Proceedings of the 
National Academies of the Sciences. The study seems to confirm several previous studies' 
theories about dolphin communication - specifically that dolphins have something like 
names which they use to announce themselves to other dolphins.

It's already believed that [dolphins have "signature whistles,"](http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2013/02/dolphins-can-call-each-other--no.html) or whistled 
vocalizations unique to each dolphin. The researchers behind this paper were able to 
get dolphins to produce their own signature whistles by playing recordings of related 
dolphins calling out to them. 

Your dog may understand its name when you call it, but you couldn't rely on Fido to tell 
people not to call her Rover. In other words, dogs don't, and in fact can't, introduce themselves. 
Introductions are exactly what this research seems to indicate is going on amongst 
dolphins. When researchers played recordings of other dolphins producing the signature 
whistle of a given dolphin to that same dolphin, that dolphin responded by also producing 
its own signature whistle. 

To get a sense of what this might look like, imagine if you were looking for 
someone named Tom over a 2-way radio. You would call out "Tom?" and he would respond with 
"Tom here!" 

This research proffers a pretty exciting and provocative idee. Language is currently 
considered by most cognitive scientists to be an exclusively *human* faculty. We may have 
to seriously re-evaluate this assumption (presumption?) from this point forward, 
especially if research in this field bears more fruit. 

If these researchers are right, then Bottlenose dolphins demonstrate cognitive 
capacities functionally akin to representation, abstraction and reference, all of which appear to be a 
requirements for a functional language faculty. If these animals are really naming themselves, this may be 
evidence that dolphins either currently have a capacity for language, or they are on the
verge of evolving that capacity.

Unfortunately, my experience has been that animal language research often ends up in
broadly interpretable results that are too easily sensationalized. Solid evidence 
for a robust ability to make reference to actual individuals might be found by documenting use of signature whistles 
in the absence of the referent.
